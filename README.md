# Add to Feedly

This Firefox extension allows you to add your favorite sites' feeds to Feedly. Despite from [original add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-to-feedly/) this one handles multiple RSS feeds too. Clicking on “Add to Feedly” button on the toolbar opens menu with all feeds available on current page. Doesn't require restart. Doesn't utilize pages' space.

[Install it at addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-to-feedly-plus/)
